It was the largest offshore platform in the Mexican Gulf located off the Louisiana coast southeast of New Orleans, with production of up to 250,000 barrels of oil a day and with reserves believed to be in excess of 1 billion barrels. Due to its size, the field was an important part of BP’s global oil exploration strategy. However, the development of the field was also a technological challenge because the drilling took place on the seabed under 1,500 meters of water and almost 4,000 meters under the seafloor'

Furthermore, the location in the Mexican Gulf exposed the seaborne oil rigs to tropical hurricanes. For example, BP’s drilling platform on the deepwater Mississippi Canyon Block 778 needed urgent repairs in 2005 when it tilted 30 degrees after Hurricane Dennis swept through Thunder Horse.'

The initial work was carried out by a semi-submersible drilling unit, the Marianas leased from the Swiss-based offshore drilling company Transocean. This rig was able to operate on water depths of up to 2,000 meters. However, the oil rig was damaged by Hurricane Ida, one of the strongest tropical cyclones in the 2009 hurricane season that caused widespread damages and passed through the northern Gulf of Mexico as an extra-tropical cyclone.23 As a consequence, drilling was halted on November 28, 2009 as the Marianas had to undergo repairs. Then BP leased another rig from Transocean, the Deepwater Horizon, to continue the work in February 2010.'

The first task was to install a so- called blowout preventer (BOP) to circumvent uncontrolled release of oil and gas in case the normal mud control should fail under the extreme pressures. The BOP is typically a specialized mechanical valve installed to cope with erratic pressures and uncontrolled flows during the drilling. As the drilling proceeded deeper, casing strings were to be set up gradually and cemented along the way as enforcement. The development drilling was challenged as mud started to enter through cracks in the casings but was resolved by pumping spacer fluid down the drill string to plug the fractures'
